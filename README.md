BlogProject
BlogProject is a .NET 8-based application utilizing a Clean Architecture design. It implements several patterns and tools such as CQRS, Mediator, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, and the Repository Pattern. The database used is SQL Server.

Features
Clean Architecture: The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is implemented to separate read and write operations.

MediatR: MediatR is used to implement the Mediator pattern, providing a way to decouple request and handler logic.

AutoMapper: AutoMapper is used to simplify object-to-object mapping between DTOs and entities.

FluentValidation: FluentValidation is used for validation of input data in a fluent and clean manner.

Repository Pattern: The repository pattern is used to abstract data access logic and provide a clean API for interacting with the database.

SQL Server: SQL Server is used as the database to store data.

Getting Started
To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
.NET 8 or higher

SQL Server (can be local or remote)

Visual Studio or any other IDE for .NET development

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlogProject.git
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

Restore the NuGet packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet restore
Set up your SQL Server database by updating the appsettings.json file with your database connection string.

Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet run
Access the application at http://localhost:5000 or the relevant port.

Database Setup
To set up the database schema, you can either use migrations or manually apply the schema:

To create migrations and update the database, run the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
Structure
The project follows Clean Architecture with the following layers:

Core: Contains business logic, domain models, and interfaces.

Application: Contains use cases, CQRS commands, queries, and application logic.

Infrastructure: Contains data access implementation using Entity Framework and the repository pattern.

API: The entry point to the application, containing the web API controllers.

Patterns and Tools
CQRS: Used to separate commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) for better scalability and maintenance.

MediatR: Facilitates communication between components through the Mediator pattern, reducing dependencies between components.

AutoMapper: Used for mapping objects, simplifying DTO to entity conversions and vice versa.

FluentValidation: Used to validate request data, ensuring that invalid data is rejected before it reaches the business logic layer.

Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic, making it easier to test and modify without affecting the business logic.
